### ML-Powered Music App – Feature Checklist & Steps

---

### FEATURE SET

#### 1. User Preferences System
- Store user-selected:
  - 🎵 Music Language (Hindi, English, etc.)
  - 🎧 Genre (Romantic, Sad, Pop, Metal, etc.)

#### 2. Smart Search Behavior Tracking
- Capture user **search queries**
- Extract and store keywords (genre, language, artist)

#### 3. Click Behavior Scoring
- If user **plays** a song after searching → strong boost
- If user **skips** it → weak or no boost

#### 4. Personalized Recommendation System
- Use stored preferences to:
  - Recommend new songs using **similarity**
  - Rank them by user’s top genres/languages/artists

---

### 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

---

#### ⚙️ FRONTEND (React Native + Expo AV)
1. **Search bar** for user input
2. **Trigger music fetch** from backend (via keyword or URL)
3. When user **plays** a track, send that action to backend:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "123",
     "search_query": "romantic hindi arijit singh",
     "played": true
   }
   ```

---

#### BACKEND (Python FastAPI / Flask)

**3. Parse the Search Query**
- Extract:
  - Genres (from a known list)
  - Languages
  - Remaining = artist name
- (Use basic NLP or keyword matching)

**4. Update User Preference Profile**
- Boost score based on `played == true`
- Store/update the user profile in DB

---

#### DATABASE (e.g., Supabase, Firebase, MongoDB)

**5. User Profile Structure**
```json
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "preferences": {
    "genre": { "romantic": 6 },
    "language": { "hindi": 5 },
    "artist": { "arijit singh": 8 }
  }
}
```

---

#### ML / RECOMMENDER LOGIC

**6. Fetch Recommendations**
- For a given user:
  - Fetch their preferences
  - Fetch metadata of available songs
  - Match user preferences to song metadata using:
    - Cosine similarity
    - Rule-based filtering
    - kNN or clustering

---

### OPTIONAL NEXT FEATURES

- Add a **"Like"/"Skip"** button to fine-tune feedback
- Build **mood detection** from lyrics/audio
- Add **trending/popular** recommendations
- Implement **collaborative filtering** with more user data
