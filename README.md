### üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è FRONTEND (React Native + Expo AV)
1. **Search bar** for user input
2. **Trigger music fetch** from backend (via keyword or URL)
3. When user **plays** a track, send that action to backend:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "123",
     "search_query": "romantic hindi arijit singh",
     "played": true
   }
   ```

---

#### BACKEND (Python FastAPI / Flask)

**3. Parse the Search Query**
- Extract:
  - Genres (from a known list)
  - Languages
  - Remaining = artist name
- (Use basic NLP or keyword matching)

**4. Update User Preference Profile**
- Boost score based on `played == true`
- Store/update the user profile in DB

---

#### DATABASE (e.g., Supabase, Firebase, MongoDB)

**5. User Profile Structure**
```json
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "preferences": {
    "genre": { "romantic": 6 },
    "language": { "hindi": 5 },
    "artist": { "arijit singh": 8 }
  }
}
```

#### ML / RECOMMENDER LOGIC

- For a given user:
  - Fetch their preferences
  - Fetch metadata of available songs
  - Match user preferences to song metadata using:
    - Cosine similarity
    - Rule-based filtering
    - kNN or clustering

### OPTIONAL NEXT FEATURES
